# Simple Blog

A Phoenix Application to work as an example of [Dayron](https://github.com/inaka/Dayron) usage. It's a simple blog consuming the public API endpoints provided by [JSON Placeholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

The API does not require authentication, but it provides a good example of basic CRUD operations.

The application does not require Ecto or a local Database server.

To start Simple Blog:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

After the above steps you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
